# Automated-Data-Quality-Monitoring-and-Anomaly-Detection-in-Datasets
In this project the data in the dataset is being checked based on the pre defined business rules and if there is any anomaly detected then a csv file is generated about the summary of anomalies and mailed to the stakeholders and a dashboard is also created using Flask
Whenever a anomaly is detected it is all summarized and a new csv file is generated 
After this a mail is sent to the person in charge or the stakeholders with the csv file attached and this process is automated for every 5 minutes
A web dashboard is also created where the person in charge or the stakeholder can see the anomalies directly on the website present in the dataset using Flask
